                Samuel L. Jackson is an American actor, comedian and film producer known for playing riotous, violent characters
                that have made him one of the most quotable, and bankable, men in Hollywood. In October 2011, Jackson surpassed 
                Frank Welker as the highest grossing film actor of all time. His films have collectively made more than $7.4 billion.
                After some years of intensive involvement in the Civil Rights and the Black Power movements, Jackson focused his energies
                on theatre while at Morehouse College. Jackson owes his career launch partly to Eddie Murphy, who got him his first speaking 
                role as a guy who holds up a McDonald's in Murphy's "Coming to America" (1988).In 2012, he starred in Tarantino's "Django Unchained" 
                as Leonardo DiCaprio's servile but shrewd house.
