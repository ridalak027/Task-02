                Will Smith was born to an African American family in Philadelphia in 1967. He was the second of four children.
                Smith began his career as a hip-hop musician in the 1980s and this led him to appear on American television. He
                drew the attention of a producer who assigned him a leading role in a 1993 film titled Made in America. Will Smith
                realized major fame when he shared the lead with Martin Lawrence on Bad Boys, a title which is considered among the best known
                action films of the 1990s. Thereafter Will Smith became well recognized due to the large revenues which the film received across the world.
                Bad Boys was not an exception as two films followed which received even higher revenues which went up into the hundreds of millions. Both films had
                similar ideas as they were both based on alien invasions of Earth, however each gave the topic different treatments.

                Thandie Newton was born in London in 1972 to a Zimbabwean mother and an English father. She lived in Zambia until the
                political turmoil in the country brought her back to the UK. Newton remained in Cornwall, Southeast England, until the age
                of 11, where she joined the London School of Art to study modern dance, but was forced to leave because of a back injury. This led her
                to seek a cinematic role until she landed a key role in, (Flirting), which was directed by John Duigan. She moved to Los Angeles, California, to
                carry on with her acting career but her English accent was an obstacle. That’s when Newton returned to England and received a diploma in Anthropology
                from Cambridge University. During her studies she participated in some roles that kept her in the eye of the public, and then joined some important movies 
                such as: (Crash), (The Pursuit of Happyness) and (Mission: Impossible II).
