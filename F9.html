                Job" (2003), "The Expendables" (2010) and "The Expendables 2" (2012). The actor usually does his own
                stunts and stage combat scenes. Stratham was a member of Britain's National Diving Squad for twelve
                years before being scouted by a sports modeling agency. This stroke of luck landed him a deal with 
                French Connection, through which he met director Guy Ritchie. After a seven-year relationship with 
                model Kelly Brook, Stratham became involved with Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
